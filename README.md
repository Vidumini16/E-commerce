# E-Commerce Product Dashboard

A full-featured React + Vite application for managing an e-commerce product catalog with complete CRUD functionality, advanced search/filter, and performance optimizations.

## Features

- **Product Grid:** Responsive display of products with image, name, price, category, stock status, and truncated description.
- **CRUD Operations:** Add, edit, delete, and bulk delete products with confirmation and undo support.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Real-time search, category, price range, and stock status filtersâ€”all combinable.
- **Form Validation:** Inline, real-time validation for all product form fields.
- **Local Storage Persistence:** Products are saved to and loaded from localStorage.
- **State Management:** Uses `useReducer` and custom hooks for robust state handling.
- **Performance:** Memoized components, debounced search, lazy-loaded images, and optimized renders.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite using React Testing Library and Jest.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error boundaries and user feedback for all operations.

## Getting Started

## Project Structure

```
src/
  components/      # React components (Header, ProductForm, ProductList, etc.)
  hooks/           # Custom React hooks (useLocalStorage, etc.)
  utils/           # Utility functions (formatting, validation, etc.)
  __tests__/       # Test files for components and features
  App.jsx          # Main application component
  main.jsx         # Entry point
  index.css        # Global styles
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **useReducer** is used for product state to handle complex updates and ensure immutability.
- **Custom hooks** (`useLocalStorage`, etc.) encapsulate reusable logic.
- **Component splitting** and memoization are applied for performance.
- **All product data** is persisted in localStorage for offline support.
- **Testing** covers forms, lists, filtering, and CRUD operations.

## Accessibility & UX

- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible.
- ARIA attributes and roles are used where appropriate.
- Loading and empty states are handled gracefully.
